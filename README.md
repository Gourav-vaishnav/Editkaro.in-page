## 🔍 **How It Works** 🧠

**Editkaro.in-page** relies on a combination of **JavaScript** and **HTML** to enable inline editing on any page. When you click on a text block, it’s converted into an editable field, allowing you to make changes. The content is then automatically saved using **local storage**.

This means you can freely edit any page content, and when you're done, you can either copy or export the changes to use elsewhere. The best part is that these changes won’t affect the actual source code of the webpage—everything stays local to your browser.
